Summary
This is a conesecutive 3 hour challange, to replicate the base design of: 
https://www.arduino.cc/
I'm going to try and spend less time on the header today.
started at 0830 will end at 1130.

Overall this one went well, but it's very rough, i would have liked to develope the interactivy 
more, same for css, spacing, hover links drop down menus etc. I could improve alot of that with 
another hour or so, i know it would take me a while to do the drop down menus.

- It seems most pages use <a> link over the top of <div> instead of buttons, within a header at 
least.
