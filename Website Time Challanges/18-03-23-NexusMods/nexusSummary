Summary:

This one was modeled after the Nexus Mods page:
https://www.nexusmods.com/

it ran a total of approximatly 3 hours, maybe 30mins extra. I got highly distracted during this 
one and it ran over about 3 days.

notes:
-It seems tha headers and footers are a common aspect across most pages, so having a fast way to
do them would be best.
-seems drop down menus are very common too, need to come up with a good way it implement them.
-If you want a background image, its best to just use a seperate element don't use background url.
-Seems best to put all your header elements in a wrapper.
-i spent most time on the header in this one, and wasted some time trying to implement the drop
down.
-overlapping elements is best done with grids.
